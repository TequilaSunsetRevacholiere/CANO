#Linux Fundamentals 
  #UNIX philosophy is to write programs that do one things and do it well
  #The Terminal allows access to the "Shell". The "Shell" talks to the Kernel

#Field Expedient LINUX
  ls 
    . = current dir
    .. = parent dir
    ~ = Home dir
    / = Root dir
  cd 
  pwd = return/print working directory
  mkdir rmdir = make directory / remove directory
  cp/mv = copy file / move file, rename
    cp [document absolute file path] [absolute destination file path]
    #you can simply rename a file by using mv, the original file, and the new file name
  rm = deletes a file/directory
    rm -rf = remove recursively and forcefully
    #you can use wildcards to delete things, i.e., rm doc*, will delete everything that has doc in it
  touch = creates file based on your specified file type 
    > = inputs contents to a new file / overwrites / creates a new file
    >> = appends something to the bottom of an existing file
  nano = command-line text editor
    nano [absolute file path]
  #Most Linux commands should have a Manual Page to describe everything that can be done with it
    man = lists the Manual Page for a linux command
      / = allows you to 
  | = PIPE commands together
    #Run this command, take the restults AND THEN | run the next command
  history = lists previous commands
  whoami =  Print  the  user  name  associated  with the current effective user ID.
  echo = displays a line of text
    echo testtest > test.txt 
      #this will overwrite whatever was on test.txt with "testtest"
  

#Remote Connection
  ping = network command to test responsiveness of a host
  ssh = Secure Shell (remote connections)
  scp = secure copy
    #SCP utilizes the same safety structure as SSH
    scp <options> [source destination]
  rsync = file transfer

  #moving the tar file into the Desktop
    cd /
    cd media/a28/Da Big One/1. Learnin'/5. Close Access Network Operations/[the file]
    cp/mv media/a28/Da Big One/1. Learnin'/5. Close Access Network Operations/[the file] ~/Desktop/
    tar -xvzf [the file]

  #There are 4 files in the Snickerdoodles directory. Find it.
    ls hansel/gingerbread-house/oven/snickerdoodles/ -latr

  #Make and remove a directory in the Gretel directory
    mkdir gretel/breadcrumb-trail
    rmdir gretel/breadcrumb-trail

  #there is a hidden file in chap-5 dir
    ls hansel/ -R
    #cp -a archives your file

  #find dorothy and make a backup
    find dorothy | cp dorothy dorothy.bak
  #copy goldfish to overwrite dorothy
    cp goldfish dorothy
  #delete dorothy, then rename the backup of dorothy to dorothy2
    rm dorothy | mv dorothy.bak dorothy2
  #move to hansel, then use dot notation to copy the file foo2 in Gretel to hansel
    cd hansel | cp ../gretel/foo2 .

#Reading Files
  cat/tac = concatenate files or characters
  head/tail = display first or last few lines
  wc = word count
  #use the \ to escape out of any really long directories

#Linux Wildcards
  * = represents any sequence of zero or more characters
  ? = represents any single character
    #ls song?.mp3
  [] = represents any reange of characters
    # [abcde] / [a-e] 
    #ls song[0-9][0-9].mp3
  {} = provides options 
    #ls {un,ack} lists files with names starting with "un" or "ack"

rm -rf /home/sherrif/therapy /*
  #this will delete the "therapy" directory and the entire Root directory

  #list files with file"
    ls *file*
  #list files from song0 to song9.mp3
    ls song?.mp3
  #list files song14 to song 17.mp3
    ls song[1][4-7].mp3
  #list prefilev to x
    ls prefile[v-x].txt
  #list all files that do NOT begin with the letter "p"
    ls [!p]*
  #list only files that begin with pre or post
    ls {pre,post}*
  #list files with numbers in the name
    ls *[0-9]*

#Absolute vs. Relative
  #Absolute starts from the highest directory to the destination
    pwd
  #Relative is the current dir you are working inside of

#File Redirection I/O
  stdin = standard input (keyboard)
  stdout = standard output
  >> = append
  < = take input from a file vs keyboard
    wc < foofile.txt
  ; = string multiple commands together
    #do this no matter what, will not care about the first command's results
  tee = splits data output into different locations
    ls | tee foo
      #will show the list in the terminal and then PIPE that data into the foo text file
  && = run multiple commands together
    #will run multiple commands, but it cares about the success of the first commands

  #combine two text files into a new file
    cat first.text spam.txt > classic 
  #use >> and spam to to create a file with spam on three different lines
    cat spam > spam 3 ; cat spam >> spam 3 ; cat spam >> spam 3
    echo -e "spam\nspam\nspam" > spam.txt
  #use a pipe to count the number of lines from the ls command and save the ouptut to a file named "new.txt"
    ls | wc -l > new.txt

#Text Editors
  vi = preinstalled, old school
  vim = vi improved, syntax highlighting
    vimgenius.com (Vim Genius Online Trainer)
    vim.rtorr.com (Vim Cheatsheet)
  nano = like wordpad, easy to use
  gedit = like notepad, gui-based

#File Permsissions
  chown = changes ownership of a file
    sudo chown [user:group] [file]
  chmod = changes the permissions of a file
    sudo chmod [operator] [file]
      sudo chmod ugo+x = adding readable and executable permissions for user, group, and others
      sudo chmod ugo-xr = removing readable and executable permissions for user, group, and others
      sudo chmod u=rwx = giving the user read,write,execute permissions for a specific file
      sudo chmod 741 = user has rwx, group has write, others have execute
      -r = readable (4)
      -w = writeable (2)
      -e = executable (1)
      - = denied 
    Owner (u) = rw-
    Group (g) = r--
    Other (o) = r--

#Users and Super Users
  useradd = add user
  adduser = add user
  usermod = modify user account
  groups user = shows which groups "user" is a part of
